## Time Complexity Analysis

### 1. `get_definitions(word)` Function
- **API Request:**  
  The function makes an HTTP request to the Jisho API using `requests.get(url)`. The time complexity of this request is `O(1)` since it doesn't depend on the size of the input.
  
- **JSON Parsing:**  
  Parsing the JSON response using `response.json()` is `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the response data.
  
- **Extracting Data:**  
  The function extracts readings and definitions, which involves iterating through the `senses` list. If there are `k` senses, the time complexity is `O(k)`. This is usually a small constant, so it can be considered `O(1)`.

### 2. `process_word(word)` Function
- **Time Complexity:**  
  This function simply calls `get_definitions`, so its time complexity is `O(k)` where `k` is the number of senses in the response. Again, this is typically small, so it's effectively `O(1)`.

### 3. `process_file()` Function
- **Reading the Input File:**  
  Reading and processing the input file involves splitting lines and words, which is `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of characters in the input file.
  
- **ThreadPoolExecutor:**  
  The function uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process words in parallel. For `n` words, each word is processed independently, so if we consider each word processing to be `O(1)` as analyzed above, the time complexity is `O(n)` for processing all words.
  
- **Writing Output:**  
  Writing results to the output file is `O(n)` since each word's result is written sequentially.

### 4. Overall Time Complexity
- **Reading the Input File:**  
  `O(m)` where `m` is the number of characters in the input file.
  
- **Processing Words (Parallel Execution):**  
  `O(n)` where `n` is the number of words in the file.
  
- **Writing Output:**  
  `O(n)` for writing the processed results.

### Final Complexity
Thus, the overall time complexity of the code is:

\[
O(m + n)
\]

where:
- `m` is the number of characters in the input file.
- `n` is the number of words in the input file.

Given that reading the input file is linear in the number of characters and processing is linear in the number of words, the code is efficient for typical use cases where `m` and `n` are reasonably small. If the API request time or the number of senses per word (`k`) becomes significant, those factors could impact the real-world runtime, but they don't change the asymptotic complexity.
